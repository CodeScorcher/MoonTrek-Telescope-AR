
---------------- Installation Instructions -------------------------------

This file hopes to help future teams of development if they want to run the application in their local computer

This project was built mainly using python and the django framework and a combination of other libraries .

- First of all youll have to get the whole project and clone it somewhere in your computer
- Now , you will are able to run the project directly from,
    - your terminal
    - Pycharm (a python ide)

its important that wherever you open the project an run it the following libraries are installed

                        Django                3.1.7
                        numpy                 1.20.1
                        opencv-contrib-python 3.4.2.17
                        Pillow                8.1.2
                        pip                   21.0.1
                        pytz                  2021.1
                        setuptools            54.1.2
                        sqlparse              0.4.1

You may have to install each individually in your computer or better in your virtual environment where you will run the project


*****  Installation through Pycharm  *****

If you have Pycharm already , i believe the installation will be easier . This application is built with python , specifically through the django web framework.

    - First open pycharm
    - select open an existing project , or the open option
    - search for the directory where you clone the project , you should select the folder inside that directory not the directory you created to clone the project. pretty much just the actual project directory. Select it and click open
    - When you open the project it may ask you what python version you want to open it with , if this option appears select , Python 3.7.9 . Youll have to choose  3.7.9 , or if not nothing will work. You can download and install the version here  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/
    - When you select the python version when opening the project make sure is 3.7.9  , itll appear there if you installed it .
    - If it promtps you choose pip 21.0.1
    - Now the project should be loaded in your window . If you look on your left there should be a similar project structure MoonTrekTelescopeV2 with another folder with the same name inside , and then inside a media , MoonTrekTelescopeV2,routeapp,static, and templates folder
    - now lets check that all of the libraries that we need are installed in your virtual environmnet where your project is placed .
        - Go to the botttom of pycharm there should be a terminal window , click on it

            - run the following command:  pip list

            - you should have the following items installed
                        Django                3.1.7
                        numpy                 1.20.1
                        opencv-contrib-python 3.4.2.17
                        Pillow                8.1.2
                        pip                   21.0.1
                        pytz                  2021.1
                        setuptools            54.1.2
                        sqlparse              0.4.1


            - if you dont have the above items installed youll have to install them manually with pip (for example pip install Django====3.1.7
            - You need the specific versions as above , specifically for python and opencv
            - install each item with the pip install command .
            - when each item is installed if you run pip list , you should see the list above . The most important versions you should keep same are for django , numpy , opencv-contrib-python , Pillow , and Python


    -After the required libraries are installed you can run the project by running manage.py . Youll have to switch to the directory where this file is , which is in MoonTrekTelescopeV2/MoonTrekTelescopeV2/manage.py
    - The command is : python manage.py runserver
    - You should be able to go to  http://127.0.0.1:8000/



*****  Running through terminal  *****

- Youll have to create a virtual environmnet within the project with pip
- inside the virtual environment install all of this
                        Django                3.1.7
                        numpy                 1.20.1
                        opencv-contrib-python 3.4.2.17
                        Pillow                8.1.2
                        pip                   21.0.1
                        pytz                  2021.1
                        setuptools            54.1.2
                        sqlparse              0.4.1
-once this exact libraries are installed navigate to the folder where the manage.py folder is
- run the command : python manage.py runserver
- project should be loaded on http://127.0.0.1:8000/




Final Notes :
I recommend getting used to python and how to run a django project in your local computer for the first few days before diving into the project
Like that youll have a better sense of the running and installation process . The running process is pretty easy as long as you know how to create a django application or your familiar with it . In pycharm is pretty easy because when you select opening
a project itll create the virtual environment for you . You just have to make sure you install the libraries with the exact versions with pip . The python version and opencv are really important for the project to succefully run the computer vision parts .

# Description
Overall goal : Creating a Web Application in which the user will be able to provide an image capture from a telescope or mobile device. When feeding an image of the moon  , the application will provide additional information to the user about its moon feed. The features that are provided are important annotations such as important landing sites, local temperatures, chemical makeups of the soil -- such as iron, etc. 

Technologies

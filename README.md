# Goal : 

Build upon the previous Moon Trek Django-web application where the user shall capture an image of the Moon from their own telescope or shall upload a corresponding image of the Moon into the web application.

The user shall give the image to the web application, then in turn the web application provides point of interests on the Moon such as craters, maria, and landing sites. The Augmented Reality portion of the project lies in improving the data overlays, creating a 3D model of the Moon created by Jet Propulsion Lab's high-quality images of the Moon and user uploaded images of the Moon.

The team's objective is also to complete the telescope to computer communication, improve the accuracy of the image registration, and create a 3D-model of the Sun, Moon, and Earth based from the images uploaded. The same 3D model of Earth will also show an annotation of where the picture was taken and the time it was taken.
